-my function that plots all of the different mass particles in a Xx3 grid using the yt plotting interface
--found in graphs rockstar
--needs to be updated to use newer functions

-my function for plotting all of the different mass particles in different colors on the same plot
--found in graphs rockstar
--mostly done I think

-update my 3-d graph to work with a baserockstar_ascii input directory
--in graphs rockstar and Mass-Distance Comparison

-massanddistancecomparison.py currently works for non-sub halos
--does this need to be updated

-test my new arttoascii.py file with parser

-finish the finding stars program
-add more elements to ascii file of the finding stars program?

-convert programs to work with my new consistent reader
--catalogprojections.py
--massdistancecomparison.py


-add -h for all of my parse arguments

-I made a symbolic directory that points from my anaconda package folder to satellite_analysis
--find folder by using import yt yt.__file__
--will need to make it so that installing with pip or another method works in the future when I am ready to share this
